This is my first exercise in dsci522 and i am just making some changes

git branch <name>: create a branch <name> in your current HEAD location

git switch <name>: switch to the <name> branch

git switch -c <name>: create <name> and switch to it in one go, from HEAD

when you push the brnch to github, it will automatically update the PR
